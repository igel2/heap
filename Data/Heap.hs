-- | A flexible implementation of min-, max- and custom-priority heaps based on
-- the leftist-heaps from Chris Okasaki's book \"Purely Functional Data
-- Structures\", Cambridge University Press, 1998, chapter 3.1.
--
-- There are different flavours of 'Heap's, each of them following a different
-- strategy when ordering its elements:
--
--  * Choose 'MinHeap' or 'MaxHeap' if you need a simple minimum or maximum heap
--    (which always keeps the minimum/maximum element at the head of the 'Heap').
--
--  * If you wish to manually annotate a value with a priority, e. g. an @IO ()@
--    action with an 'Int' use 'MinPrioHeap' or 'MaxPrioHeap'. They manage
--    @(priority, value)@ tuples so that only the priority (and not the value)
--    influences the order of elements.
--
--  * If you still need something different, define a custom order for the heap
--    elements by implementing a 'HeapPolicy' and let the maintainer know,
--    what's missing.
